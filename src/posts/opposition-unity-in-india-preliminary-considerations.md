Over the past decade, India has been wracked by a prolonged crisis, combining economic stagnation with social upheaval.

The [rate of growth](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=IN) of India’s economy has slowed and [inequality](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/top-1-hold-22-of-income-india-among-most-unequal-nations-shows-report/articleshow/88149699.cms) has risen along with poverty and [unemployment](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/unemployment-rate#:~:text=India%20unemployment%20rate%20for%202021,a%200.03%25%20decline%20from%202017.). India faced an unprecedented public health setback during the Covid-19 pandemic, with up to 5 million [deaths](https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/in/), although the national government has only officially acknowledged a tenth of that figure. Meanwhile, two well known [business](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1368503/adani-group-net-worth-of-gautam-adani/) [conglomerates](https://www.thinkforu.org/2023/01/Mukesh-Dhirubhai-Ambani-Chairman-and-MD-Reliance-Industries-Biography.html) are said to be the principal beneficiaries of the post-2014 trajectory of economic growth, which, if true, would result in the majority of Indian businesses and millions of people effectively being left behind.

India’s political landscape has been reshaped by the coalition government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Religious prejudice, casteism, patriarchy and other signs of social inequity have been [unleashed](https://www.fairobserver.com/world-news/indian-media-a-victim-of-neoconservatism-and-cronyism/) to an unprecedented degree. It is scarcely deniable that these trends have taken hold of the public sphere in the country.
